# FFB-Mock-Draft
A fantasy football mock draft tool for one user to practice drafting against computer selected teams.

Defaults to a 14 team league with 14 man rosters. There is not yet a roster configuration (number of starters at each position) as this is only a basic tool and many features are still being added. Computer teams will always draft 2QB 5RB 5WR 1K 1DEF.
